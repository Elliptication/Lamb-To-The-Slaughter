Do you know of anything that may have been used as the weapon, Mrs. Maloney? Something like a very big spanner?

* I can't think of anything. There may be something in the garage.
-> Denying

* Hmm.... Perhaps a leg of meat from the freezer?

Such as the one you put in the oven?

* Yes. The one in the oven, actually.
-> AgreedRes

Mrs. Maloney, I'll have to bring you to the station while we investigate.
